Function that takes 4 arguments

-Thing wanting to be found the number
-The array of sorted elements
-"First" element
-"Last" element

Returning
-Return Address
-Eveuntally the value 1 or 0 for found or not found

Algorithm
-Check if First > Last and if so return 0;
-Will need a variable to store the middle which is the pivot of the algorithm
-Checking if the middle is the value x
-else check if x is larger than the value at middle then
	-If so recursively call binary search again on the left side
-else if x is smaller than the value
	-recursively call binary search on the right side

MIPS:

#a0 is the sorted list
#a3 is the value being searched for
#a1 is the size
